# Why you should consider starting your blog in 2023?

First of all, before telling you - "Why you should start blogging in 2023", let me clear something up for you: after reading this blog, you may consider starting a blog yourself. However, you might wonder, "What should I blog about?" The answer is much simpler than you think.

**"You can/should blog about what you learn on a daily basis can help your readers learn from your experiences. By sharing your insights, you can provide valuable information that can benefit others in your field or with similar interests."**

*Let me share two simple examples to give you a perspective:*

* Suppose you are learning a new technology, such as ReactJS or NodeJS. In that case, you can **share what resources you are using**, **what projects you are working on**, and any **issues you may have faced and solved**, among other things.
    
* The same applies even when you are just getting started with learning something like C programming. You can share what you learn, such as **what are if-else statements** and **loops**, **provide examples**, and **include links to resources** and much more.
    

Having cleared that let's explore: How starting a blog in 2023 can be a great way to help advance your career by **building your name/personal brand** and **increasing your visibility online**:

* Increase your visibility:
    
    Blogging can help you get noticed by **potential clients**, **employers, or collaborators**. By creating content that is valuable and relevant to your target audience, you can **attract attention.**
