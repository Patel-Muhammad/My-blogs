Have you heard of **GSoC** or **Google Summer of Code**? It's an amazing program 🌟 **sponsored by Google** that offers students from all around the 🌎 the chance to work on open-source projects every year and get paid 💵 for it.

📈 Over the years, GSoC has mentored more than **18,000** new contributors through **746** open-source organizations since **2005**. These organizations are eager to teach newcomers 📚 about their communities and the excitement of open-source development.

By participating in GSoC, you'll have the chance to **work on real-world projects** with experienced mentors and contribute to the open-source community. It's a great way to **gain practical experience**, **learn new skills** 🤹, **and make a meaningful impact**.

### Here's how it works:

1. 📅 Google opens applications for open-source organizations to apply. *(January 23 - February 7)*
    
2. 🔍 Google then selects the organizations that will participate in GSoC 2023. This year, 172 open-source projects have been selected, including 18 new organizations. *(February 22)*
    
3. 💻 Each organization selected for GSoC has project ideas based on various tech stacks like web development, Android, machine learning, AR/VR, and more.
    
4. 🔎 Students interested in participating in GSoC go through the list of projects and identify the ones they want to apply for. *(February 22 - March 19)*
    
5. 🤝 Students then contact the mentors associated with those projects to discuss the details and seek guidance. *(February 22 - March 19)*
    
6. 📝 Once students have a clear idea of what they want to work on, they submit a project proposal to the organization. This is the most important step, as it outlines the student's plan for the project and their expected outcomes. *(March 20 - April 4)*
    
7. 🔎 After receiving all the proposals, the organizations review them and select the students they want to work with. (April 4 - May 3)
    
8. 🎉 Finally, the organizations release the list of selected students, who then begin working with their mentors to complete their projects over the summer. (May 4)
